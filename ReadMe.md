-1 microsecond, 2 microseconds and 5 microseconds execution times are obtained by running the same algorithm for the given datasets.

-If problem size is increased execution time is increased.

First time checked. First of all, index information was kept. This information holds the assigned facilities. Then we assigned the point by looking at supply and demand. We kept the assigned points in the assignmentList. Then we used the Greedy Algorithm to assign the remaining points to the facilities. Here, it was aimed to bring the points to the facilities by minimizing the distance. Facilities have been added to the openedFacilities array. The index of the facilites was kept. Again, we added the assigned points to the assignmentList. Afterwards, the distance was checked according to the facilities, aiming to find the shortest distance for each remaining point. If the supplies of the faculties are greater than the demands of the points, the assignmentList is updated. Time was checked again.
With the MinimumTotalDistance method, the distances of the points were iterated and a total was reached. If this total satisfies the conditions, the index is increased. If the conditions are not met, false is returned. At the end, the index number was returned and repeated.
